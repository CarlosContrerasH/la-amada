The Calgary Herald recently interviewed our Sales Director and a number of our full time residents to create an in-depth profile of our offering at La Amada. Deeming our community “a private little oasis,” the article focused on La Amada’s unique location “tucked between three kilometres of white sandy beaches to the east and the Chacmochuc Lagoon nature reserve to the west,” away from the noise and bustle of Cancun but still close enough to take in the resort town’s dining and nightlife when you choose.

Our one-, two-, and three-bedroom homes range in size from 1,200 to 3,000 SF, and are located in eight buildings spread across the property. The “exquisitely built” homes feature “travertine marble flooring throughout, soaring ceilings and walls of windows that completely open up for indoor-outdoor space in the units’ back terrace.” As the Calgary Herald article notes, each building location offers a unique living experience for its residents:

> *The lagoon offers a quiet, serene view of green lush jungle. The beachfront has the turquoise Caribbean, white sand and palm trees. The marina can be lively and the sun sets over it.*

The article interviewed one of our full time residents, a long time citizen of Cancun who chose to purchase at La Amada because he strongly believes “there is nothing that compares in the whole region.” However, the Herald piece also pointed out one of the key benefits of owning a luxury condominium at La Amada Residences: while some residents choose to make La Amada their home year round, owners are able to place their homes in La Amada’s rental program. A dedicated concierge “will be able to receive those guests, give them the house rules, take them to their unit, provide them with the keys and a tour of all the amenities.”

Lastly, the Calgary Herald piece touched on the exciting new developments happening at La Amada. The new developers who purchased this luxury Caribbean community are focused on enhancing the resort to make it a true luxury destination, “investing in completing the owners’ experience” by adding a wealth of amenities “to serve the needs of a full community,” including a brand new Beach Club and much more:

> *“We’re going to bring in a café with a market, we’re going to bring in a state-of-the-art gym facility that’s much larger, a kid’s club, an owners’ lounge with a pool table and people have access to games and books and internet, and we’re having a huge expansion to our existing Beach Club. We are adding several pools to that, a larger restaurant service where will be able to offer meals longer than just lunch, to offer more of a dinner opportunity, swim up bars.”*

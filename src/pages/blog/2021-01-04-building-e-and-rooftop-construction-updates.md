The construction team continues to make great progress at La Amada. Our newly built port cocheré structure will transform a guest’s arrival experience at La Amada. New shade canopies are also in place above both the Building E pools. We have also caught a glimpse of the new lobby while the interior work continues in that area.



From a kid’s point of view, perhaps the most important update near Building E is the new play structure, which replaces a less exciting activity area.

Check out our latest photos and stay tuned for further updates as our amenity enhancement project gets much closer to overall completion.

Dwell has profiled La Amada Residences in a recent feature on our resort’s interior design and real estate offerings.

The design publication lauded La Amada as an “exquisite collection of one- to three-bedroom for sale residences with breathtaking views that range from oceanfront to the alluring on-site marina and lush Chacmochuc Lagoon reserve,” all nestled in 20km of private Caribbean beachfront in the “peaceful paradise” of Playa Mujeres.

Dwell praised La Amada’s decision to “showcase authentic and local inspired designs” throughout our interiors, creating a laid back luxury aesthetic. “Residence interiors include marble flooring and lavish stone at full length, solid custom wood cabinetry and high-end appliances such as Miele and Bosch,” with generous layouts that “encourage indoor and outdoor living.”

The article also dove into the benefits of La Amada ownership, including the long list of amenities and activities available to those who decide to purchase a home at La Amada:

> *Guests will enjoy miles of the beaches, peaceful marina, scuba diving and snorkeling, as well as a short boat ride from the second largest coral reef in the world, Cozumel. Owners can also take advantage of the nearby shopping and entertainment destinations within downtown Cancun and the chance to dig into the surroundings of Riviera Maya, including Playa del Carmen and Tulum.*
>
> *In addition, residents can enjoy an array unique outdoor activities such as world-class fly fishing and kite-surfing in the nature preserve of Chacmochuc Lagoon, whale shark watching and deep-sea fishing off the coast of Playa Mujeres, day trip exploration to the nearby Isla Mujeres and bird watching at the well-known Isla Contoy. Residents will also have all-access to the Playa Mujeres Golf Club that boasts an Greg Norman designed 18-hole golf course recognized as one of the best Mexico can offer.*

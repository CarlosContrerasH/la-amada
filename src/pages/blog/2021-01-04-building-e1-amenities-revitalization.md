The proposed new amenities for building E1 are nothing short of transformational, creating a vibrant hub of activity and recreation. A place to shop & eat at the cafe /deli, to work out in a seriously well equipped and spacious gym, to chill out in the residents lounge, to entertain the kids, to take a swim (in the rooftop or ground floor pools), to take a rooftop massage overlooking the Chacmochuc reserve and more, all within minutes walk of the Beach Club. This will also be the place to host friends and guests or to watch the big game in the private party room as well as becoming the arrival check-in point for owners and guests.

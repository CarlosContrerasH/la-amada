Capture Magazine has named La Amada one of its recommended luxe beach retreats in Mexico. Describing our “luxurious waterfront living” community as “something spectacular,” the article cites La Amada’s enviable location, our impressive amenities, and our impeccably designed condominiums as reasons we’re the top getaway on the Caribbean coast.

In addition to our new Beach Club, rooftop pools, fitness center, and Kids’ Club, the luxury lifestyle publication was impressed by the unique opportunities for ocean adventure provided by our private marina:

> *One of the few deep-water marinas along this stretch of coastline allows boaters to moor, charter a deep sea fishing excursion, or summon a catamaran for a sunset cruise to Isla Mujeres just across the bay.*

La Amada’s “spate of luxury services” including “excellent dining, spa, golf, swim, and abundant opportunities for the sports enthusiast” and its convenient access via direct flights from major North American cities also drew praise from Capture Magazine. While La Amada’s location in the midst of the “abundant flora and fauna” of the Chamochuc Nature Preserve makes it feel like a “remote escape,” the article points out that our luxury condominiums are in fact “ideally situated close to the first-rate shopping and breadth of diversions in bustling Cancun.”

The design of our condominiums also received ample praise from Capture Magazine, who gave our “discrete enclave of modern residences” a glowing review, highlighting design features like our Residences’ custom wood cabinetry, top of the line appliances, and sliding glass doors for indoor-outdoor living “taking advantage of the expansive sea and sky.”

With our new beach club complete and fully operational, construction on the remaining amenity updates in building E is now in full swing.

Over the past few weeks, workers have been framing in shade structures and constructing the new gym, cafe, and market place spaces. Click above to view our progress video, where you can see the progress made to-date in building the swim up bar on the rooftop and the porte-cocher√®.

Workers are moving quickly to get us through this stage of disturbance, with the outdoor pools and rooftop amenity currently on pace to be completed by the end of September.

With so many improvements coming to this building, we are featuring some of our residences for sale in building E.

Once our new mini-mart, coffee shop, upgraded roof top pool, concierge desk, and gym are completed, building E will become the center of the La Amada community.

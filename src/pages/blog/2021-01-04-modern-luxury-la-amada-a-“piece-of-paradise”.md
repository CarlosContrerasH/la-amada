Modern Luxury wrote a glowing piece on La Amada in the latest edition of their online magazine. Hailing our community as “a piece of paradise,” the article highlights our unique luxury offering and proximity to Cancun as our chief selling points, gushing that La Amada “captivates with white-sand beaches, a sprawling fairway, and unparalleled privacy–all a stone’s throw from bustling Cancun.”

> *Idyllic–that’s the word that comes to mind when arriving at La Amada Residences, a superb property composed of 215 luxury condominiums spread out across eight freestanding buildings in picturesque Playa Mujeres, Mexico.*

From the sweeping views to the spacious layouts, Modern Luxury praises our condominiums as “blissful beachfront living quarters” perfect for entertaining, with high end finishes and the option to have La Amada’s designers “fully furnish your new digs in luxe style.”

Our stunning array of amenities also receives enthusiastic praise from the luxury lifestyle publication, which proclaims that our newly renovated Beach Club with infinity pool, swim-up bar and private cabanas, state-of-the-art fitness center, rooftop pools, and 18-hole Greg Norman Golf Course is a “posh paradise” that would “leave little reason to venture off-site.”

Construction began last Monday, and already we have seen significant activity on the site. The Beach Clubâ€™s building contractor is a local Cancun area firm with a history of completing some beautiful boutique properties throughout the region, including the Nizuc resort and spa (pictured below).

### MINIMIZING DISRUPTION

During this construction period, the contractor is working to mitigate any disruptions on the property by taking steps such as placing dust screen fencing around the job site and timing deliveries during regular working hours. Perhaps most importantly, there is extra staff onsite to keep the project moving smoothly.

### EXPECTED COMPLETION DATE

We are impressed by the rate of change on the Beach Club site after just a few days. At the current pace, the disruptive period will be reasonably short, and we will be enjoying a new Beach Club by April. See our photo gallery below to view some construction activity photos.

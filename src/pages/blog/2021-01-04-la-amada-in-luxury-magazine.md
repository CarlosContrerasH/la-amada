La Amada is a collection of 215 fully completed spectacular residences, 130 of which are now offered for sale. The residences are located within [Playa Mujeres](https://www.laamada.com/location/playa-mujeres/), which is a private community with its own [marina](https://www.laamada.com/location/playa-mujeres/#marina) and a spectacular Greg Norman designed [golf course](https://www.laamada.com/location/playa-mujeres/#golf).

The La Amada Residences share all [amenities](https://www.laamada.com/amenities/) between the residents of all buildings. Owners enjoy access rights throughout the broader, community including beach and boardwalk access.

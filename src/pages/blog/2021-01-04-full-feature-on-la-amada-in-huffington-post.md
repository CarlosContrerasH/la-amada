Huffington Post contributor Norm Schriever visited friends living at La Amada, and has published a glowing review of our community based on his experiences. From the layout and architecture of the resort to its amenities, activities, and interior design, Schriever highlighted the perks of ownership at La Amada along with what sets us apart from other destinations in Mexico.

> *Only a few miles up the peninsula towards La Mujeres, and I felt like I was in a completely different place, the real Mexico. In fact, that strip is one of the treasured locations for luxury tourists and expatriates alike, with four of Mexico’s top-rated resorts meandering up the coastline.*

>
> *I was starstruck from the moment we pulled in, as the community’s main “street” was a green grass avenue – something I’ve never seen before anywhere in the world.*
>

> *Likewise, wandering around the grounds, I was impressed with its regal palm trees, manicured lawns, tufts of wild grass and sunbaked stone paths, leading me to the beach. Ahhh the beach! Not only is the powdery expanse of sand and aquamarine ocean postcard-worthy, but we also could get wet in one of their infinity pools that overlooked the sea. The property of La Amada even has its own adjacent marina, where I strolled around, window-shopping among multi-million dollar yachts with flags from all over the world.*

Schriever’s article, fittingly titled “Why I’m moving to La Amada in Cancun, Mexico,” provided a detailed overview of a day in the life of a La Amada owner. From golfing at our Greg Norman 18-hole course to taking in the El Meco Ruins ruins at sunset and fly fishing in the lagoons around Playa Mujeres, Schriever touched on the unique advantages of ownership at La Amada that can’t be found in properties in Cancun.

Schriever also marvelled at La Amada’s thoughtful layouts and authentic, locally inspired interior design. From our 1-bedroom luxury condominiums to our stately penthouses, every detail of these fully renovated and redesigned residences was created to showcase the best of modern Mexican interior design while utilizing the highest quality finishes.

> *When I first went inside, I thought there must have been some sort of mistake because the sprawling villa was something out of a movie, an immaculately designed three-bedroom unit befitting an international business tycoon.*
>
>
>
> *Built by HAMAK, a world-renowned luxury hotel designer, I spent a full hour meandering around the vast floorplan admiring the gourmet kitchen, luxurious marble floors throughout, custom wood cabinetry and doors, and plenty of sliding doors and large vistas that brought the gentle sea breeze into my room.*
>

> *After inquiring, I found out that they do have penthouses for sale up to $1.2 million. They even gave me a tour of one, and I was instantly jealous of the floor to ceiling windows with views of the ocean and the nature preserve, and rooftop pools. But the units at La Amada start for a very reasonable $300,000; in my opinion a pittance for the quality of the spaces, lifestyle, and amenities they offer.*

After touring some of La Amada’s unparalleled array of amenities, Schriever was amazed to learn that the marina, Beach Club, and pools were only the beginning of what La Amada will offer its owners. With our $\_\_\_\_ renovation well underway, our [future amenities](https://www.laamada.com/amenities-future/) will include a Health Club, Marketplace Café, Residents’ Lounge, Kid’s Club, and a spectacularly renovated new +23,000 ft² Beach Club, which opens in spring 2018.

In all, Schriever’s experiences left him feeling exactly how we want owners in our unique community to feel: entirely at home, enjoying their dream lifestyle in a luxury community in the heart of Mexico’s Yucatan Peninsula:

> *As I sat with my new friends at La Amada, dining on delectable Mexican food prepared right there by their in-house chef, sipping wine and conversing among kind and interesting people from all over the world who had chosen a better life there in Playa Mujeres, it dawned on me: La Amada was more than just a place I wanted to be on vacation, it already felt like home.*

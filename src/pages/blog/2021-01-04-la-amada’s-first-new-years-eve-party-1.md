La Amada’s residents and friends gathered on New Year’s Eve to celebrate the coming New Year together. We enjoyed champagne and local seafood under the stars at our beautiful new beach club. It was a great opportunity to see some old friends and make new ones together with our families. We suspect this party was the first in what will become a New Year’s Eve tradition at La Amada in the future.

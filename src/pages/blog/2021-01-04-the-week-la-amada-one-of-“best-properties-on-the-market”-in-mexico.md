La Amada is “a steal” and one of the best properties currently on the market in Mexico, according to The Week. This is what the weekly media digest had to say about La Amada on their feature on homes in Mexico:

> *Part of a private Caribbean enclave on a peninsula north of Cancún, this one-bedroom condo features a gourmet kitchen, marble floors, custom woodwork, and high-end bath-room design. The residence comes with access to a Greg Norman golf course, private beaches, a marina, sports courts, a gym, and restaurants.*

Cancun, Mexico (XX) – La Amada Residences, a private new collection of residences located within Playa Mujeres, Mexico, announced today the launch of sales for its luxury mid-rise condominiums. With a $6M renovation underway, La Amada Residences will introduce an array of additional amenities in late 2017, including a new fitness club, upscale gourmet food shop and an exquisite new Beach Club, exclusive to La Amada owners and their guests. As the only residential offering in Playa Mujeres, La Amada offers contemporary luxury tucked between 3 km of white sandy beaches to the east and the Chacmochuc Lagoon nature reserve to the west. Prices begin at the low $300,000’s and range over $1.3M.\
Featuring 140 for-sale residences dispersed throughout five unique buildings, with terraces boasting spectacular views of the surrounding lush lagoon and nature preserve, the peaceful Marina V&V, and the surrounding ocean, residents will discover a modern-day monument to 21st century coastal living. With floorplans ranging from one- to three-bedrooms and interiors spanning from 1,200 to 3,000 square feet, the La Amada Residences embody a sophisticated, contemporary habitat that hasn’t forgotten the vibrant spirit of Mexico’s legendary past. Interiors offer marble flooring and luxurious stone throughout, solid custom wood cabinetry and high-end appliances such as Miele and Bosch. Purposefully designed for its beach-centric location with a focus on architectural expressions of light and space, the collection of residences effortlessly connects indoor and outdoor living with large glass sliding doors and outdoor spaces that range from expansive terraces to sprawling Penthouse rooftop decks.\
Owners and their guests will enjoy the privileges and conveniences of hotel living while having exclusive access to a full suite of concierge services and amenities, including private access to the newly renovated Beach Club with a blend of infinity pools, shaded loungers, a swim up bar with the best of contemporary Mexican design, two roof top pools, tennis and paddle ball courts, numerous cabana and barbeque spaces, Owners Lounge, world-class gym, Marketplace Café, and a private lobby and office center. In addition to the private stretch of beach and marina boardwalk, residents will also enjoy the many acres of pristine preserved wetlands that provide the backdrop for La Amada and is also home to a variety of rare and protected species.

“La Amada Residences has found a piece of virtually untouched Mexican landscape that combines the serene escape each of us long for with elements of adventure we never knew we were missing,” said Julie Quigley, Sales Director for La Amada Residences. “We are thrilled to launch sales on this piece of paradise and invite future residents to celebrate everything Playa Mujeres has to offer.”\
La Amada is located in the heart of Playa Mujeres, a secluded 20 km peninsula perched on the northeastern tip of Mexico’s historic Caribbean coast. Residents can fully enjoy miles of Playa Mujeres’ beaches, the peaceful marina, and spectacular Greg Norman designed 18-hole golf course within the private community. Playa Mujeres is also adjacent to Isla Mujeres, a Mexican island located 13 km from the coast, a destination known for its unparalleled scuba diving and snorkeling, as well as a short boat ride from the second largest coral reef in the world, Cozumel. Just outside of Playa Mujeres, residents can also take advantage of the close proximity to popular shopping and entertainment destinations within downtown Cancun and the opportunity to explore the vast surroundings of Riviera Maya, including Playa del Carmen and Tulum. La Amada is located at Calle Vialidad Paseo Mujeres, Mza. 1 Zona Continental, Lote 10 SM 3, Isla Mujeres, 77400, Cancun, Quintana Roo, Mexico.\
With renovations already underway, renovations are set to be completed by winter of 2017.

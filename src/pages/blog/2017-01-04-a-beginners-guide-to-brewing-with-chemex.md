Gio is a glossy new digital/print publication highlighting luxury travel, real estate, lifestyle as well as exclusive interviews with A-list celebrities, reaching a highly affluent readership across Los Angeles.

In a feature titled “Mexico Moxie,” La Amada is positioned as an exclusive residential offering in a highly desirable location, with unrivaled amenities and access to a wide array of activities around Playa Mujeres. A slideshow incorporates over 20 gorgeous images of the property, and the piece lists pricing information, the La Amada phone number and a link to the website.

You can view the story [online here](https://giojournal.com/mexico-moxie/). We will circulate a PDF of the print coverage once it runs in early July.
